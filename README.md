Spaceship Titanic Prediction Capstone Project

Overview
This project explores the **Spaceship Titanic** dataset from Kaggle, a fictional sci-fi scenario where passengers aboard a luxury interstellar cruise may have been "transported" to another dimension. The goal was to build a binary classification model to predict transport status based on passenger demographics, cabin details, and spending behavior.

Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Engineer meaningful features from complex variables (e.g., cabin codes, spending habits)
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Interpret model predictions using SHAP values
- Visualize insights and performance metrics

 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Techniques**: Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model interpretability

Key Results
- Achieved [insert accuracy or F1-score] on test data  
- Improved model performance through ensemble methods  
- Identified key features influencing transport prediction (e.g., VIP status, cabin location)



  
 Visual Highlights
- summary plot showing top predictors  
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve for model performance  
- Feature distribution charts for exploratory analysis

Takeaways
This project strengthened my skills in:
- Working with messy, real-world-like data  
- Building interpretable machine learning models  
- Communicating results through visual storytelling
